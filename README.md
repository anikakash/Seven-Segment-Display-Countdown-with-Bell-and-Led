# Seven Segment Display Countdown with Bell and Led

# Description: 
In this project, we are going to make a 0 to 9 number countdown in a seven-segment display and add some extra features. When The Countdown starts The light starts to blink one after another with the bells and displays.
The Display shows Digit 0 to 9 sequentially, one by one with 1000 millisecond intervals.
With the countdown, the LED also starts to blink. When the digit of the countdown is 0, the first light lits. When the digit of the countdown is 1, the first light stops and the second light lits. In the next steps, the LEDs start blinking one after another like this.
The buzzer also makes sounds with the countdown. When the digit of the display is 0, the buzzer plays for 1000ms. When it is 1, the buzzer plays for 100ms. In the next steps, the same steps are repeated.
 In our life, we work all the time with digits and displays. So we choose this type of project so, after this one, we can be doing more advanced projects like this one. Seven Segment displays are used in many places like Digital clocks, Calculators, and other Numerical Devices. We are using our programming skills and our Circuit Designing Knowledge which we learned from our previous semester. For this project, we wrote code in the c++ programming language. And to simulate, we used the TinkerCad Web version.
So after This Project, we can get a good idea about how to control Numerical Display and control electronic equipment with Arduino.

# Equipments:

# Description Of Equipment:

## Breadboard: 
Letâ€™s Understand Breadboard Connection to see the below picture


## Arduino Uno R3:
Arduino is a programmable board where a microcontroller is previously installed. It can take input and output via its pin. Basically, there are three types of pins: Digital pin, Analog Pin and Power Pin.
